<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>
  All my hobbies surround being active and outdoors. They are healthy ways that
  I have found to relieve stress, and feel fully present.

  <h2><li>Rock Climbing</li></h2>
  <p>
    I have been climbing since 2015. It has been something that has pushed me to
    be more bold, and challenege me physically and mentally.

  <h2><li>Running</li></h2>
  <p>
    I have only recently begun my running journey. I am currently signed up for
    5 races this year, with the last one being a 50k. The dedication and
    discipline I have put towards training is something that I can feel proud
    of.

  <h2><li>Camping</li></h2>
  <p>
    The main thing I love out camping is spending quality time with those who go
    with me. There is nothing more peaceful than unplugging, and being fully
    surrounded by nature and friends.
